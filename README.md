# Data Science and Analytics Repository üìà

Welcome to my Data Science and Analytics Projects Repository! This space is dedicated to a range of projects and experiments I've embarked on to enrich my understanding and skills in data science and analytics. You'll discover projects that delve into complex data analysis, predictive modeling, statistical studies, and insightful visualizations.

## About Me üåü
Driven by a passion for data and its transformative impact, I delve into the realms of data science and analytics to propel organizational growth and decision-making. This repository is a chronicle of my journey, showcasing how I turn raw data into meaningful insights and predictions. It's a path of ongoing learning and development, where I aspire to not only refine my skills but also contribute significantly to the world of data.

## Projects Overview üìä
In this repository, you'll find a variety of projects, each telling its own story about data:

[Waze Data Analysis Project P.2](/Data-Science-and-Analytics-Repository/Waze_Project/P2-Exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb): This project delves into the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Waze's user data. I've initiated the project with a data inspection and organization phase using Python, and now I'm progressing into the EDA phase. The project is structured into four parts:

1. Data Preparation: Involving imports, links, and data loading.
2. Data Exploration and Cleaning: Focused on understanding the dataset's structure and cleaning it for analysis.
3. Building Visualizations: Creating insightful visualizations to interpret user behavior and trends within the data.
4. Evaluating and Sharing Results: Analyzing results and drawing conclusions about user churn and engagement.

Throughout the project, I apply the PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) problem-solving framework, enriching the analysis with Python tools such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to derive insights from the data, particularly focusing on user churn and engagement, through various statistical and visual techniques.

## Technologies and Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è
The projects in this repository employ a diverse array of technologies and tools integral to data science and analytics, including:

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Automating scripts in Python to build out repetitive visualizations
- SQL for Data Retrieval
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Power BI)
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- GCP BigQuery... among other exciting technologies!

## Learning Resources üìñ
I've gained valuable knowledge from a variety of resources. Here are some that have been instrumental in my data science journey:

1. [Google advanced data analytics certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics?)
2. [Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/)
3. ChatGPT
